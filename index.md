Why use R?
==========

R is a programming environment with a focus on mathematics and statistics, but can be used for a variety of applications given the flexibility of the language. R is also free and available for all operating systems. Given the richness of the language and no cost to use it, bioinformaticians have adopted R as the platform for which which to develop packages to solve bioinformatics problems.

Getting R
=========

Point your browser to <http://cran.r-project.org/> to download and install the latest version of R. For these tutorials we are also going o use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) which is an advanced environment for R which includes a window for an editor, console, and plotting window. You will see what this means later.

With respect to bioinformatics, the central repository for bioinformatics tools is [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) where packages are deposited for easy installation.

Before we go on to these, we need to get to grips with the basics of the R language first.
